# Bash Config Repo

Hey there!  This little repo is just a spot to stash my Bash config files. Nothing fancy, just my personal setup to keep things sane.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> ~/.config/bash
   ```

2. Symlink the main profile file:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/.config/bash/bash_profile.bash ~/bash_profile
   ```
And that's it! Enjoy my Bash madness.
